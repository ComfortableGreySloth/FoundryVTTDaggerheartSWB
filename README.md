Version 1.1 Update Notes:
Corrected "Hand Runes", and "Shortsword" damage to "d10" from "d4."

Corrected domains for the "Rogue" class.

Added a cap of 10 to the fear pool.

Added "Stairways (Teleporter)" module to the list. This is used in the third scene of the quickstart adventure (which currently has no tokens.)

Duplicated "Summon Dialogue" macro and edited copy for the quickstart adventure adversaries.

Reorganized the GM hotkeys: Bar 1 has the animation macros for NPC attacks, blood splatter, quickly changing their attributes, and toggling token torchlight. Bar 2 has macros for toggling flight, increasing or decreasing progress/fear counts, the quickstart adventure adversary summon, and summoning action tokens. Bar 3 has all the duality dice macro, including one for each character trait (which only work if you have a character sheet assigned to the user.)

Created scenes, journal entries, and map notes for the quickstart adventure "The Sablewood Messengers". Note that the carriage animates best if you click and drag the horse, rather than using WASD. Definitely a rough draft, the tokens in scene two have a "Patrol" but scene three is empty. The treehouse in scene 4 is "animated" to gently sway using the "Patrol" module as well.

Added intuitive icons to the duality dice macros for character traits. Appended the trait used to the result section of the chat message.

Added the duality dice macro to all weapon item macros, associated with the relevant character trait. Added dialogue boxes to weapons that needed them to switch between melee and ranged (just the scepter.) If your character throw their weapon in very close range just use the default animation, or modify it yourself. 

Duplicated relevant domain card items (due to varying spellcasting traits), and added the appropriate duality dice macro to them. Reorganized domain card items into subfolders.

Added icons to each domain deck. Created domain deck templates, to facilitate higher level deck creation (Just make a new folder for the level -> duplicate the relevant templates and put them in the player folder -> change the name and description of the cards.) 

Added "Ancestry", "Class", "Community", and "Subclass" decks to card stacks.

Created new card folders for each player, with duplicates of ancestry, community, and level 1 domain cards within each, and reorganized card structure. Ownership already implemented per player, including the "Mini HUD." You probably won't have players with the same class and subclass, if you do then just duplicate the decks as needed.
