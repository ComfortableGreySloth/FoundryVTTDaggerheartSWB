# FoundryVTTDaggerheartSWB
This is my Simple Worldbuilding hack for the Daggerheart RPG beta playtest. It only covers level one content at this time, it is largely an engine for you to play your own games.

Much gratitude goes to K2 for his collaboration in this project, and my players for assistance in playtesting.
